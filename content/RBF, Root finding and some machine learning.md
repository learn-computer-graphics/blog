# RBF, Root finding and some machine learning

> Some usefull maths for your next algorithm and get started with some data-analysis used by machine learning.

## [Machine Learning](https://github.com/learn-computer-graphics/machine-learning)

Two articles dealing with the following problem : With a given set of data, how do you partition it in order to create meaningful groups ?

### [K-Means](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/machine-learning/blob/master/classes/Clustering/K-Means/K-Means.ipynb)

One of the most-used partitioning algorithm, but it has some constraints as you'll see.

### [Mean-Shift](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/machine-learning/blob/master/classes/Clustering/Mean-Shift/Mean-Shift.ipynb)

A more expensive but less restrictive way to partition your data.

## [Mathematics](https://github.com/learn-computer-graphics/mathematics)

These four subjects are not directly related, but they might come handy for your next project (it was for us, though the reason behind their redaction).

### [Radial Basis Function](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/mathematics/blob/master/classes/interpolation/rbfInterpolation.ipynb)

It is a technique which allows you to create a function going through the points you asked for. You can map it in 3D so that you have a terrain-creation tool !

### [Root Finding](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/mathematics/blob/master/classes/calculous/root-finding.ipynb)

The multiple techniques to find the square root (or more). It is an operation that is very common in computer graphics and we show the complexity of these algorithm.

### [Integers storage](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/mathematics/blob/master/classes/data-storage/integers.ipynb)

A simple article explaining how computers are storing integers in memory. It also shows tricks that can be used by the programmer to use them even more efficiently in some cases.

### [Derivative](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/learn-computer-graphics/mathematics/blob/master/classes/calculous/derivation.ipynb)

We know how derivative works as maths students but your computer might have some problems thinking about it (rounding problems to), let's see how this works.
