Notes :

- Usage of jupyter notebook in order to execute code and create diagrams
- Usage of iframe inside of notebook to display about anything, and be independent from version breaks
- Independent repository for each subject, and use of blog to glue them all into one website
- Continuous integration and push on custom server
- Usage of subdomains for each project
- A dependency repo hidden from public to get js dependencies
